# Jumpy Extension for Visual Studio Code

## Feature Overview

Jumpy provides fast cursor movement, inspired by Atom's package of the same name.

## Commands

When Jumpy is activated, decorators (two-letter codes) are created in the area around your cursor. Then simply type in a two letter code to jump to that position.

Where the decorators are created is dependent on the command you use:

* `extension.jumpy-word` (Jumpy Word Mode): decorates words in the area around your cursor
* `extension.jumpy-line` (Jumpy Line Mode): decorates non-empty lines in the area around your cursor

No default keybindings have been provided with this extensions, to avoid conflicts. Instructions for setting up your own keybindings are [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings)

## WARNING

This is an alpha release! More functionality, speed improvements and more are planned very soon.
